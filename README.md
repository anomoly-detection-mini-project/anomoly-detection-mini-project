# Anomoly Detection Mini Project

# Project Goals:
  * Explore the curriculum logs collected from the Codeup SQL database.
  * Answer at least 5 of 7 questions asked of the data
  * Provide takeaways that can be used in a presentation to stakeholders
  
# Questions that we answered:
  1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
  2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?
  5. At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?
  6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
  7. Which lessons are least accessed?
  
# Steps to reproduce:
  1. Clone this repo
  2. Use env file to acquire data from Codeup SQL server
  3. Save data as .csv in local file
  4. Run desired notebooks
